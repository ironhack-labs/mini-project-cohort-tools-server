# API Documentation

This documentation provides an overview of the available routes and data models for the Cohort Tools API.

Throughout the project, you should use this documentation will as a reference and a guide. Consult it whenever you need information or guidance on how to implement the routes or model your database.

## Routes

In this section, you will find detailed information about the different routes available in the API.
The API offers a variety of routes to work with *cohort* and *student* documents. Each route is associated with a specific HTTP verb and URL, allowing you to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, and Delete) actions on the data.

##### Cohort Model

```js
// We intentionally left this section unfinished because we want you to actively participate in the process.
// As you work on your database, you'll need to define the data models to practice structuring your database data (data modeling).
// The purpose of this section will become clearer as you progress in your project.
```

##### Student Model

```js
// We intentionally left this section unfinished because we want you to actively participate in the process.
// As you work on your database, you'll need to define the data models to practice structuring your database data (data modeling).
// The purpose of this section will become clearer as you progress in your project.
